# sentiment-analyzer-api
This is a python prototype to serve existing sentiment analysis model(s), or to create new ones, through an API. It's part of my professional portfolio.  

## IN PROGRESS:
- Adding algorithms to balance dataset classes using `SMOTE`.
- Adding support for **pytorch**.
- Implementing dataset classes for **tensorflow-keras** model implementation using `tf.keras.Sequence`.
- Adding support for **huggingface pipelines**
- Write **unit tests**
- Adding routes to upload new data (experimental)
